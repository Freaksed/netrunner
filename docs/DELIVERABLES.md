### Documentation  
- **`docs/README.md`** (6KB) - Overview and usage guide
- **`docs/ability_language.md`** (9KB) - Complete language specification with examples

### Implementation
- **`docs/enhanced_ability_engine.gd`** (22KB) - Updated Godot engine supporting all features

### Example Cards
- **`docs/examples/advanced_snare.json`** - Access restrictions and conditional effects
- **`docs/examples/data_sucker.json`** - Virus mechanics and central server triggers

## üéÆ Language Features

### Ability Types (7)
- `static` - Constant effects while active
- `triggered` - Automatic activation on events  
- `paid` - Player-activated with costs
- `subroutine` - ICE subroutines
- `install_restriction` - Installation limitations
- `play_restriction` - Play limitations  
- `replacement_effect` - Rule modifications

### Timing System (20+ triggers)
- Turn structure events
- Run progression events
- Card lifecycle events
- Player action events
- Complex timing with filters

### Condition System (25+ queries)
- Player state (credits, clicks, tags, etc.)
- Card counting and filtering
- Zone operations
- Dynamic game state
- Logical operators (and, or, not)

### Effect Types (40+)
- Resource modifications
- Card manipulation  
- Run mechanics
- Damage and traces
- Counters and advancement
- Server interactions
- Choice and conditional effects

### Advanced Features
- **Dynamic Values** - Mathematical calculations from game state

- **Replacement Effects** - Rule modifications
- **Complex Targeting** - Filtered selection with player input

## üîó Integration Ready

The language is designed for seamless integration:

1. **Backward Compatible** - Works with existing card format
2. **JSON Schema Validated** - Ensures correct definitions
3. **Engine Support** - Enhanced ability engine provided
4. **Documentation** - Complete usage guide
5. **Examples** - Real cards demonstrating all features

## üåü Highlights

This comprehensive language successfully captures the full complexity of Android: Netrunner's card interactions, from simple resource modifications to complex multi-step abilities with player choices and dynamic calculations. It provides a solid foundation for implementing any current or future Netrunner card while remaining human-readable and maintainable.

The validation tools ensure that card definitions are correct, and the enhanced ability engine provides a reference implementation for processing the language in the Godot game engine.

**Result: A complete, validated, and implementation-ready ability language for Android: Netrunner! üöÄ**
