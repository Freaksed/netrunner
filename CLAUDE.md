# CLAUDE.md

This file provides guidance to Claude Code (claude.ai/code) when working with code in this repository.

## Project Overview

This is a Godot 4 implementation of Android: Netrunner, a two-player asymmetric card game. The project uses GDScript for all game logic and implements a data-driven ability system for card effects.

## Development Commands

### Running the Game
```bash
# Run the game
godot

# Run specific scene
godot --scene scenes/main.tscn

# Run in editor mode
godot -e
```

### Project Management
```bash
# Convert project files if needed
godot --convert-3to4

# Export project (requires export templates)
godot --export-release "Linux" netrunner.x86_64
```

## Architecture

### Core Systems

The game uses an event-driven architecture with several key systems:

1. **Event Bus** (src/autoload/game_events.gd): Central event system for game state changes. All major game actions emit signals through GameEvents autoload.

2. **Card Database** (src/autoload/card_database.gd): Manages card data loading from JSON files in cards/data/. Cards are referenced by set and ID.

3. **Game Manager** (src/core/game_manager.gd): Orchestrates game flow, manages players, handles turn structure. Creates LocalPlayer and RemotePlayer nodes.

4. **Player System** (src/player/player.gd): Base player class handling clicks, credits, deck operations. Specialized into PlayerCorp and PlayerRunner for side-specific logic.

5. **Ability Engine** (src/rules/ability_engine.gd): JSON-driven ability execution system. Interprets card ability definitions to execute game effects, handle conditions, and manage costs.

### Game State Flow

1. Main scene loads â†’ GameManager initializes players
2. Players load decks from JSON files (user://decks/)
3. Game setup: shuffle decks, draw cards, set initial resources
4. Turn loop managed through GameEvents signals
5. Card plays validated through Player.valid_to_play()
6. Abilities executed through AbilityEngine with JSON definitions

### Card Data Structure

Cards stored in cards/data/{SetName}/{id}.json with:
- Basic properties (title, type, cost, strength)
- Abilities array with timing, conditions, effects
- Deck building info (faction, influence)

### UI Architecture

- **2D Hand**: src/ui/hand2d.gd manages card display in hand
- **3D Playfield**: Cards on table rendered as 3D objects
- **Deck Builder**: src/ui/deck/deck_builder.gd for deck construction
- **Identity Panels**: Display player state (credits, clicks, faction)

### Key Autoloads

- **SceneStack**: Scene management and navigation
- **CardDatabase**: Card data loading and caching  
- **GameEvents**: Global event bus for game state changes

### Testing Approach

Currently no automated tests. Manual testing through:
1. Running main scene
2. Loading test decks from user://decks/
3. Verifying card interactions in-game

## Development Notes

- Game uses Godot 4.4 with mobile renderer
- All scripts in GDScript
- Card abilities defined in JSON, not code
- Event-driven architecture via signals
- No external dependencies beyond Godot
